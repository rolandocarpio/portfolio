# 🟢 FALLOUT TERMINAL PORTFOLIO
> _"Booting Pip-OS® version 2.0.25_

A retro-futuristic personal portfolio inspired by my time hacking terminals in _Fallout 4_. Featuring glowing green CRT graphics, scanlines, terminal animations, and immersive UI components. All powered by React, Vite, and an Express backend.

A modern developer portfolio as if it were running in an abandoned Vault-Tec workstation... still active after 200 years.
